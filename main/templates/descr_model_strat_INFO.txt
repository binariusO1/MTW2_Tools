;	SSHIP - modified by Lifthrasir June 2019
;	review for 098 by Belovese using bovi's checker:
;		commented lines to be deleted later if no problems arises, every line with:  timurids, teutonic_order, rebels, milan
;		if so also delete relevant tga and dds files


;	this file contains the model linkages for both strategy map and battlefield; it gets 
;	parsed on application startup but is not otherwise referred to. the data format is thus:
;
;	;						indicates a comment ;-)
;							
;	type					indicates a new model type
;
;								must be followed by id name string
;
;	skeleton				indicates which skeleton should be used for these models
;
;								must be followed by id name string (cf descr_skeleton.txt)
;
;	indiv_range				indicates at what point we start rendering men individually even if 
;								we can 'group render'
;
;								must be followed by an integer (whole number) range in metres
;
;								group render means the whole unit will be rendered using one 
;								model, individual render means the soldiers will be	tested 
;								individually for which model lod to use (slower) 
;
;	(models)				there must be at least one; the model_ keywords indicate a new model in
;								the lod series; each must be followed by a filename and either the
;								lod range in metres or the word 'max' for maximum range... all lods
;								must be in order, from shortest distance (highest detail) to furthest
;								distance. The model_ keywords are:
;
;			model_flexi_m		essentially a flexi model but has a small number of weighted 
;								vertices, such as Will's high-detail carthaginian infantryman 
;								with the weighted shoulder verts 
;			
;			model_flexi_c		a flexi model which contains per-vertex colours, for example 
;								for colouring the different Roman faction assassins
;
;			model_flexi			plain vanilla flexi model, which is a single-skinned mesh with 
;								normals and texture coordinates
;
;			shadow_model_flexi	as model_flexi but used to create the shadow volume	
;
;	model_mesh				(optional) range only for using animated mesh frames for the model
;
;	model_sprite			(optional) sprite model for this model type 
;
;								if the first item is a distance (integer number in m), a new 
;								sprite animation set will be generated for this model; if it is 
;								anything else, it must be a type name from this file which has a 
;								valid sprite entry *and* was processed before this type entry
;
;	model_tri				(optional) indicates that this model can be represented by a single 
;								triangle
;
;								must be followed by a range (integer number in metres), and three 
;								floating point numbers in the range 0.0f - 1.0f which indicate 
;								colours red,green,blue to use for the triangle
